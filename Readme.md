# Antarctica_29.shp - East Antarctic Atlantis Model Shapefile

EA Model Shapefile repository
## Work in progress: adding a polygon (tot. 29)

## Background

The EA model is a spatial explicit ecosystem model designed to do ecosystem assessment and MSE . In this repository, we provide the "Antarctica_28.shp" shapefile, which represents the boundaries and geographic features (Polygons) of the EA model for Antarctica.

## History of the File

- **[Antarctica_28.shp](Antarctica_28.shp)**: This shapefile serves as the main input for the Atlantis model for Antarctica. It was created in ***** (This should be updated) based on a comprehensive data collection and processing effort (cite the people that worked on that).
        This model is a small version of the original EA model designed by Beth Fulton and concentratated around #### and &&&& (and something here)
- **add BGM files**
- ** add .sh file to run Begemizer*
## Decision Process for Polygon Creation

The creation of the "Antarctica_28.shp" shapefile involved the following steps:

1. **Data Compilation**: Relevant environmental and geographical data for Antarctica were collected several sources, including ..... *(not sure what data was used but I guess somehtin like -> satellite imagery and scientific surveys.)*

3. **Spatial Analysis**: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools were employed to define the boundaries and attributes of the polygons within the shapefile. *(Add somehting about the work in any GIS tool that was done for the map)*

4. **Validation**: The shapefile's accuracy and consistency were verified through comparisons with existing datasets and maps. This validation also includes the elicitation with domain experts.
