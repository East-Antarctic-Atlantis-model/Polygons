# EAA map - 29 boxes
Previous map had 28 polygons; south of Kerguelen Plateau (Banzare Bank) has been split in two to reflect different flow regimes.
Box_id attribute has been fixed to avoid repetition and errors in running model.
Coordinate system code to read in file into QGIS: ESRG:32542 - WGS 72BE / UTM zone 42S.

## WIP status:
- [ ] Create bgm file using .sh script
- [ ] Repair centroids using R script
- [ ] Check that new map works!
